# Graph-Processing-using-Map-Reduce
Detecting Graph Connectedness using Scala 

• Developed a Map-Reduce algorithm to find the graph connectedness of any undirected graphs to be used with SDSC Comet
supercomputer cluster.

• Implemented this algorithm using Hadoop Map- Reduce in Java.

• Later implemented the algorithm in Spark and Scala to achieve 50% - 60% improvement in speed.
